<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">This assignment proved to be a
little more of a headache than I thought. I spent most of my time
trouble shooting then actually doing to assignment. I started out but
getting my webserver to accept xyz format. Never tried to get a
custom type before so initially I thought how to send this over. But
then since byte data in buffer it shouldn’t be a problem. So form
the information in the readup it was fairly easy to read the xyz
content header. All I had to do otherwise was get the content type
method to recognize .xyz. Editing the registry to recognize the .xyz
type was a major issue. Initially I took a registry back up using
CCleaner also manually exported every registry so it would be easier
to restore. Restore point didn’t really make sense to me at that
point. At first I had a bit of an issue reading from the assignment
so I ended up creating random registries but then a Brief tutorial
and a sober 3 hours of trying to understand I was able to create the
registry in the following order	:   	Regedit -&gt; HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
-&gt; MIME -&gt; Content Type rightclick -&gt; new -&gt; Key -&gt;
rename the new registery to application/xyz (like how you did in the
content type method in MyWebServer -&gt; right lick on the newly
created registery -&gt; new -&gt; String Value - &gt; name it as
Extension -&gt; right lick on extenstion -&gt; Modify -&gt; .xyz 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">AND YOU’RE DONE! MyWebServer
worked. It downloaded the mimer-data.xyz file to the AppData temp
directory using localhost:2540/mime-data.xyz.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">The shim.bat file made it even
trickier than I thought. I copied the shim.bat from the assignment.
Changed the directories to my development director “C:\Users\prati\”
and removed the rem. I used the xstream and xpp jar files from the
assignment and put it in the jdk library directory first. The main
issue was how do I associate shim.bat to .xyz since it would throw a
DLL error every time I tried to associate it. A day of searching and
I founding that the xyz extension needed to be added to Indexing
options.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Open Indexing Options in Control
Panel -&gt; Advance -&gt; File Types -&gt; then type type in xyz and
click on add. Next open Control panel -&gt; Programs -&gt; Default
Programs -&gt; Associate a filetype or protocol with a program -&gt;
Select .xyz  and click on change program -&gt; looking at more
programs -&gt; Brows and select shim.bat and you’re done. Now when
you run the webserver and when you use the browser to access xyz file
from the server it launches the shim.bat file. Added new xstream
object and converted it to xml and stored it in mimer-data.output as
a local file. Next for the Back Channel I tried to integrate it with
the Handler and the webserver using BCClient.java and the BC Looper
snippet. Initally I got a xstream ClassDefMissing error. When I
googled it most of solutions involved wrong libraries so I went to
xstream.github.io and got the latest library jars. Xstream and xpp3.
Still was getting the same error. In the assignment I saw that we
should visit and read xstream. On the website it said to use
xmlpull.jar so I put it in there. Only after beating my head on a
stone I read the other .bat files and realized the class path needs
to be set too for the web server. So I made a bat file called
StartMyWebServer to set the class path and start the mywebserver.</P>
